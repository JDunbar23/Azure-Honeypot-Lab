<h1>Azure Failed RDP to IP Geolocation Honeypot Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The PowerShell script contained within this repository is designed to extract data from Windows Event Logs regarding unsuccessful RDP intrusion attempts. It then employs a third-party API to gather geographical data related to the origin of the attackers.
<br />
<br />
This script is utilized in the context of my Azure Sentinel configuration, where it is connected to a live virtual machine serving as a decoy for potential cyberattacks. I have personally witnessed live attacks, particularly RDP brute force attacks, originating from various locations worldwide. To visualize this information, I utilized a custom PowerShell script to retrieve the geographic information of the attackers and visualize it on an Azure Sentinel map.
